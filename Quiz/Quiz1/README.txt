1. The closest programming language to binary code is the assembly language which doesn't need any interpretation to be read by the machine

2. Fortran which is 40 years old

3. C is a second generation programming language
   Fortran is first generation, C is a second generation. C++ and Matlab are Third Generation.

4. C was created 30 years ago, but C++ was created 20 years ago, and MATLAB was 15 years ago

5. The ancestor of C is BASIC

6. The ancestor of C++ is C

7. The ancestor of MATLAB is Fortran

8. c = cell(2);
   c {1,1} = [1,3,-7;2,0,6;0,5,1;]
   c {1,2} = 'This is a text string'
   c {2,2} = []
   c {2,1} = [3+4i,-5;-10i,3-4i;]
   c = {a,b;e,d}
   
9. Gives the element in the second row of the cell array, and since no column specified it defaults to the first column

10. Column wise, which means it stores data in its memory as a 1xn array which is a long column. 
This storage method is more efficient for data collected on rockets so that it can analyze array data in multiple methods, like by the diagonals of the array. 
If you ask it for the diagonal of a matrix it gives you the answer as a column, which is readable for the computer.

11. 8 bytes

12. It will cap it at the int32 max which is 2147483647
