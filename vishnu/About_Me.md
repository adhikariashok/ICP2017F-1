**Hello!** My name is Vishnu Ananthkumar.
My ~~reason~~ passion for engineering started at early age as I found a natural curiousity to create and design new devices.
As I got into middle school, I started learning the basics of programming and got a hands on experience
with a 3-d modeling through a software called Autodesk Inventor.
*Throughout my high school I knew that I wanted to become an engineer but I didn't really no much more than that.*
When my school offered us a chance to take community college courses, I jumped at the opportunity to get a hands on engineering experience.
By taking courses like **multivariable calculus, differential equations, and technical drafting,** I realized I was interested in the 
`computational` 3-d modeling aspect of engineering. Still I wasn't clear on exactly what that meant for me as a person. 
As I started my college search I discovered an opportunity to take my community college credits to help me graduate a year early 
in high school and transfer these credits to a four year college to save around 3 semesters.
I figured that I could take advantage of this opportunity an pursue higher studies while I was younger and more study-oriented.
As I took an *aerospace engineering* course in my junior year, I understood that this was the area of study that best suited my interest,
and soon I applied to UT austin. I want to use my skills from my bachelor's degree to pursue a master's and a pHD, and I hope to bring 
about revolutionary change with my research to benefit the world.
